In this repository, we have carried out several tasks related to handling Excel files and generating financial reports with Python. The main activities performed are detailed below:

We created a 3D graph using the Matplotlib library. This graph represents the evolution of sales by year and by month for three different business units.

We modified the code of the 3D graph to include a title and labels for the X, Y, and Z axes.

We developed a functionality to convert Excel files to CSV format using the Pandas library. This functionality allows us to import data from Excel to other applications or load it into databases.

We created a Python script that converts all Excel files in a given directory to CSV format.

We developed a functionality to convert Excel files to JSON format using the Pandas library. This functionality allows us to load data from Excel into web applications or exchange data in JSON format.

We created a Python script that converts all Excel files in a given directory to JSON format.

We developed a functionality to convert CSV files to Excel files using the Pandas library. This functionality allows us to work on CSV files using Excel features such as charts or pivot tables.

We created a Python script that converts all CSV files in a given directory to Excel files.

We developed a functionality to convert JSON files to Excel files using the Pandas library. This functionality allows us to work on JSON files using Excel features such as charts or pivot tables.

We created a Python script that converts all JSON files in a given directory to Excel files.

We developed a functionality to convert Excel files to HTML format using the Pandas library. This functionality allows us to publish Excel data online or embed it in websites.

We created a Python script that converts all Excel files in a given directory to HTML format.

In summary, we have performed a series of activities that allow us to manipulate and convert Excel files in different formats, which provides us with greater flexibility and possibilities to work with data in different contexts.
